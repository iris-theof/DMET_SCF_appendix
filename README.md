# Installation
Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/install is the only prerequisit to run the project.

# Project motivation
Using few site lattice non-interacting Hamiltonians we build some of the ingredients of the mathematical ingredients of Density Matrix Embedding Method e like the projection in different spaces and we investigate whether it has a unique fixed point. The calculations presented are cheap and could be run in a laptop, as they are meant to be pedagogical and not for investigating realistic systems.

# File Description
In this project we include two Jupyter Notebooks one for the calculations presented in Appendix A and one for Appendix B of our draft "Approximations based on density-matrix embedding theory for density-functional theory".

# How to interact with the Project
 In the Jupyter Notebooks we explain step by step what is calculated with python including equations in latex and text. The full draft of the paper will also be soon uploaded.

# Acknowledgments
In this project Dr. Michael Ruggenthaler and Dr. Teresa Reinhard have collaborated.
